# MagicMirror_Project
This is a project I made in my 3rd year of university. It is supposed to be a gesture controlled smart mirror, powered by a raspberry 4.
The "config.js" file, is the actual configuration file. There, you can find the modules used.

In order to flip through the pages, you need to show the camera the number of fingers, that correspond to that specific page.
(ex. 1 finger for the first page, 2 fingers for the second page, 3 fingers for the  third page)
The gesture recognition algorithm needs to run in parallel with the application, because the gestures are being recognized in real time, and are mapped to the arrow keys.
